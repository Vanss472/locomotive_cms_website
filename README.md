Uses LocomotiveCMS to build company website.
================================================

- Created a liquid page to manage the index page.
- app>views>pages>index.liquid
- Beside the liquid page, I used liquid tag inside the CMS.
- Like <h1>{{page.title}}</h1> and others.

- Under public>stylesheets>jms-style.scss is the main custom stylesheet for the website beside the foundation offcanvas css files.
